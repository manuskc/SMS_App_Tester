{"name":"Sms app tester","tagline":"A framework for testing SMS services and apps on any android phones","body":"#SMS Tester App#\r\n\r\nAn application and a testing framework to test sms app.\r\n\r\nUsing this application you can test your sms based application on a real device.You can define your test cases in a simple csv file and execute all the test cases over multiple android phone without any supervision.\r\nThe application downloads the test file, executes all the test cases by sending sms and reports the results.\r\n\r\nExample app:\r\n* Twitter SMS app - We could define various test cases like to send a registraton message, accpet by replying code to a specific number, send a tweet, expect response message to have a success response.\r\nThe above test cases could be defined in 4 lines of csv file.\r\n\r\n* Facebook SMS app - We could define test cases for accessing wall posts, read the message to find out specfic link letter that is to be used to send next message to post comment or like the post.\r\nAgain these test cases could be written in a couple of lines.\r\n\r\n* txtWeb apps - Every apps on txtWeb could be tested by accessing the keyword and tested by expecting a response message pattern. Also a forms and links in the resonse can be extracted and sent in next message.\r\n\r\nGood this about the framweork:\r\n* Aims to be complete solution for testing any SMS service via a simple interface to describe test cases.\r\n* Sends sms from a actual device and hence as good as manual testing but much more effecient since there is no manual intervention\r\n* Understands the problem of SMS, It automatically retries by sending SMS whenever it does not receives a response within timeout and also gracefully handles all the duplicate messages created in the process.\r\n* Runs literally on any android phone - built with minimum Android SDK version 2.2\r\n* Testing framework is easily extendable and componenets are pluggable\r\n    * Easy to add a new test type - example test for regex, test for endsWith/startWith etc.\r\n    * Add new getMessage type - could send a static message or a specific part of message extracted by previous message etc.\r\n    * It is easy to plug getMessage() and testTypes() to create various combination\r\n* Can send message to specific number and expect message from specific address\r\n* Handle invalid message received - example some spam message sent to device during testing wont crash the testing.\r\n\r\nMore documentation will be added soon on exactly how to use and extend testing framework.\r\nCurrently this is in a alpha version (a work in progress) - I am using it to test few SMS services I am currently maintaining mostly to test that stabilty of framework and imporve it.\r\nIf you want to give it a try see the sample csv file attached.\r\nGo through TestExecutor.java once and you will be up and running in few minutes.\r\n\r\nTODO's:\r\n* Use xl file instead of csv\r\n* Separarte getMessage() and executeTest()\r\n* Dependancy chain\r\n\r\nMore details to follow soon...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-43628832-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
